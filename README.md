# PROJECT: BUILDING WITH RESPONSIVE DESIGN

In this project, we got the chance to build a responsive website. We‚Äôll be cloning The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.


 Website used as example in the Odin project
